//Since in a tree a node can have many childs. So implement it:
// What are data structures we know so far:
// 1. Arrays 2. Linked List

// Problem with array is we have issues of size as size is constant here.
// Problem with linked list is access  of an element, since to access any element
// We need to traverese from starting in each case.

// Okay, what can we do then? If we are able to solve size problem of array
// We can use it to implement tree.
//Here comes vector into picture.
